# ðŸŒ¿ Leaf Health Classifier  

A simple CNN model to detect if a plant leaf is healthy or diseased.  

---

## **Quick Start**  
1.Install Requirements:  
pip install tensorflow opencv-python matplotlib numpy
```

2. **Organize Dataset** ([Download from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/csafrit2/plant-leaves-for-image-classification)):  
```
leaf_dataset/
  train/
    healthy/    # Put healthy leaf images here
    diseased/   # Put diseased leaf images here
  test/
    healthy/
    diseased/
```

3. **Run the Model**:  
```python
python leaf_classifier.py
```

4. **Test with Your Own Image** (in Google Colab):  
[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yourusername/your-repo/blob/main/leaf_classifier.py)  
- Upload any leaf image when prompted!

## **What's Inside**  
- **Binary Classification**: Healthy vs Diseased leaves  
- **Data Augmentation**: Automatic image variations during training  
- **Simple CNN Architecture**:  
  ```python
  Conv2D(32) â†’ MaxPool â†’ Conv2D(64) â†’ MaxPool â†’ Dense(128) â†’ Output
  ```
- **Training Metrics**: Visual accuracy/loss plots  

---

## **Example Output**  
```
Prediction: Diseased Leaf ðŸŒ¿âœ…  
Confidence: 0.93
```
